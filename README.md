# ChinniSravanthhi-Verilog---RTL-Coding---Combinational-Circuits
This repository contains Verilog RTL implementations of basic combinational logic circuits commonly used in digital design. Each design is written using Register Transfer Level (RTL) modeling with clear structure and comments. Testbenches are also included for functional verification using simulation tool Vivado.
